Stupid Search
===

What's the most stupid search possible (viz., a search optimized for ease of implementation, not actual performance)? I reckon this one is pretty close to n-grams. Maybe we could stick n-grams into this too.

Usage:

Put a corpus in `corpus.txt`.

```python3 search.py```

Make queries.
