Stupid Search
===

What's the most stupid search possible (viz., a search optimized for ease of implementation, not actual performance)? I reckon this one is pretty close to n-grams.

There's another implementation with n-grams stuck in there too.

Usage:

Put an ascii corpus in `corpus.txt` (nothing preventing it from working in unicode except a lot of necessary laziness...).

```python3 search.py```

Make queries.
